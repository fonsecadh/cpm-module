			<p>
				Users can transfer money from their bank account to be converted into in-game currency.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be able to transfer money users must go to the virtual bank. To do so there are two options, to go through the Bank menu or by clicking on the Chips button in the game window.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the users are in the bank window, they have to click on the "Recharge balance" button, and they will be prompted with a dialog asking for their bank credentials. Once introduced, they will see another dialog showing their current in-game balance and the amount of money they want to transfer from their bank.
