			<p>
				In order to play the game, the users need to buy chips. There is a chapter in this help system explaining how to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the users have chips, they can play by dragging the icon for the chip they want to bet and drop it in the desired button of the table of bets.
			</p>			
			<p>
				It is important to note that <b>you can bet one chip for any concrete bet</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As said in the introduction, the types of bets a player can make in this game are the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Column bet: the player wins if the ball lands on the bet's column (wins 2x1)</li>
				<li>Dozen bet: the player wins if the ball lands on the bet's dozen (wins 2x1)</li>
				<li>Fail/Pass bet: the player wins if it guesses whether the ball passes (19-36) or fails (1-18) (wins 1x1)</li>
				<li>Number bet: the player wins if it guesses in which number the ball falls (wins 35x1)</li>
				<li>Odd/Even bet: the player wins if it guesses whether the ball falls on an even number or an odd number (wins 1x1)</li>
				<li>Red/Black bet: the player wins if it guesses whether the ball falls on a red number or a black number (wins 1x1)</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>
				Once the users have made their bets, they can spin the roulette by clicking on the button with a picture of a roulette.
			</p>
			<p>
				The results of the current round are shown in the text area below the roulette's button, and display the resulting number and the status of their bets for the round, specifying the benefit they will earn from each of them.
