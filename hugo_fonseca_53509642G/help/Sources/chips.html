		</header>		
		<main>		
			<p>
				As explained in the chapter covering how to play the game, the users need chips in order to be able to play.
			</p>	
			<p>
				To get chips users must go to the virtual bank. To do so there are two options, to go through the Bank menu or by clicking on the Chips button in the game window.
			</p>		
			<p>
				Once the users are in the bank window, they have to click on the "Get Chips" button, and they will be prompted with a dialog asking them the number of chips they want from each type.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember that in order for the users to get chips they need to have enough in-game currency. If the users do not have in-game currency they can always transfer money from their bank accounts to the game. Check the chapter on how to transfer money for more information.
